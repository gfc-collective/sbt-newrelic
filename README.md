Prerequisites
-------------
The plugin assumes that sbt-native-packager has been included in your SBT build configuration.
This can be done by adding the plugin following instructions at http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/ or by adding
another plugin that includes and initializes it (e.g. the SBT plugin for Play 2.6.x).

Installation for sbt-native-packager 1.3.1 or newer (and Play 2.6.x or newer)
------------

Add the following to your `project/plugins.sbt` file:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.gilt.sbt" % "sbt-newrelic" % "0.3.3")
```

Installation for sbt-native-packager 1.0.x/1.1.x (and Play 2.4.x/2.5.x)
------------

Add the following to your `project/plugins.sbt` file:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.gilt.sbt" % "sbt-newrelic" % "0.1.16")
```

To enable NewRelic for your project, add the `NewRelic` auto-plugin to your project.

```scala
enablePlugins(NewRelic)
```

Configuration
-------------

To use a specific New Relic Java Agent version, add the following to your `build.sbt` file:

```scala
newrelicVersion := "5.1.0"
```

To add a New Relic license key to the generated `newrelic.yml` file, add the following to your `build.sbt` file:

```scala
newrelicLicenseKey := Some("1234567890abcdef")
```

An alternative approach is to pass the license key to your application via the `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable.

To enable custom tracing, add the following to your `build.sbt` file:

```scala
newrelicCustomTracing := true
```

To include the New Relic client API in your project's library dependencies, add to your build:

```scala
newrelicIncludeApi := true
```

To provide a static `newrelic.yml` file instead of a generated file, place the
file somewhere (e.g. `resourceDirectory`, which is `conf/` by default for Play
applications, or `src/main/resources` for many other builds), and refer to it
from your build like this:

```scala
newrelicConfig := (resourceDirectory in Compile).value / "newrelic.yml"
```

By default, the agent will not report Scala Futures as transaction segments,
and they will not contribute to the transaction's reported total time. If you
want to enable this, you can add:

```scala
newrelicFuturesAsSegments := true
```

The application name reported to New Relic may be modified by setting `newrelicAppName`, the default value is the name of the project.

```scala
newrelicAppName := "My Application"
```
